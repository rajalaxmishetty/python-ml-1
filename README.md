Used the data set diabetes.csv 
I used KNN mode to prediction of diabetes. In this there are 768 rows and 9 coulumns.
Here our dependent variable is outcome and all other are independent variable, then splitted out the data into two sets
Then train the model on training dataset using KNN algorithm,using trained model we predicted the values of our testing dataset
At last calculated the matrices and find the accuracy
Got f1_score of 73% and accurcy of 81% ,implementing that this model is good and feasible.
